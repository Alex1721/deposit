    "## Miscellanea and troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "After this first MIP model it's time to say something more about Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Re-running code on Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Code on Jupyter notebooks is fed into Python one cell at a time. If the notebook is written correctly, you should be able to click into the first cell, then just do a `shift`+`enter` through the last cell without any error.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also able to re-run any cell multiple times, in any sequence you want. However, be aware that Python sees a sequence of cells it is given, and does not know whether an instruction should be undone or not. Therefore, once a cell is run, its results are _persistent_, at least until we reset them. One big red button is the __Restart__ command under the _Kernel_ tab in the menu: it clears all memory of whatever was done in the cell so far (though obviously not file operations). Later in this notebook we show an example of the trouble persistence can cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "Indentation is crucial: in a `for` loop, an `if` block, or a function definition, the inner part __MUST__ be indented consistently. Python will throw an error in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in [1,2,3]:\n",
    "print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the `print` instruction should be indented by at least one space.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if i==4:\n",
    "    print('i is 4')\n",
    "  print('deal with it')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here indentation is inconsistent.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myfunction(a):\n",
    "return a**4 + 5*a**3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Same as the first incorrect example. The correct way to write these examples is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in [1,2,3]:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "if i==4:\n",
    "    print('i is 4')\n",
    "    print('deal with it')\n",
    "\n",
    "def myfunction(a):\n",
    "    return a**4 + 5*a**3\n",
    "```\n",
    "The suggested indentation is 4 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment vs. equality\n",
    "The sign `=` is for _assignment_, while `==` is for checking equality of two expressions. You can write `if a == 4` but not `if a = 4`. Also, writing the statement `a = 4` is correct, and so is `a == 4`; however, the latter has no effect (apart from returning `True` or `False` on the Python command line).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semicolons, be gone!\n",
    "You may have noticed that Python doesn't require semicolons (`;`) at the end of each instruction, as other languages like C, C++, Java, AMPL do. This makes for more readable and prettier code, but indentation is enforced with this in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a statement on multiple lines\n",
    "Related to the last point: conditions can be split on multiple lines as long as a `\\` is added at the end of all but the last one, for example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if i==3 or \\\n",
    "   i==4:\n",
    "    print('i is not 5')\n",
    "```\n",
    "But the `\\` is not necessary if there is an unclosed parenthesis, for instance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (i==3 or i==5 or\n",
    "    i==7):\n",
    "    print('i is prime')\n",
    "```\n",
    "### If you're feeling a bit masochistic...\n",
    "A good way to check if your Python program was written according to the standard is to run the `flake8` module on it. Just run `flake8 myprogram.py` and check all the errors it throws (there are usually a ton)."
